# Project Overview

  - Here I created a site using multiple UI patterns and then populated the page with information from an API.
  - The page allows you to scroll through all 22 Studio Ghibli Films with click-able movie posters. Clicking the posters displays a breif description, name of director, and the original title.

## Thought Process

  - My processes was intially to build a basic form of the page and make sure it was functional with the information form the api. I then made sure that my UI elements were present with the information from the API and proceeded with styling.
